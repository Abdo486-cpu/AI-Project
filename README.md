# AI Pathfinding Project

This project implements various pathfinding algorithms in Java to determine the optimal path in a given environment. The implemented algorithms include:

- **A*** (A-Star)
- **Uniform Cost Search**
- **Other common pathfinding techniques**

## Features
- Efficiently finds the shortest path using different algorithms.
- Compares performance and results of various approaches.
- Modular Java implementation for easy modifications and extensions.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdo486-cpu/AI-Project.git
   ```
2. Ensure you have Java installed.
3. Compile and run the project:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```

## Usage
- Modify the input environment to test different pathfinding scenarios.
- Run the program and analyze the output for different algorithms.
